\section{Math equation}
\label{equations}
My first equation is $F=ma$. My first equation is $F=m   a$.
My second equation is \( a=F/m\). My second equation is \[ a=F/m\].

My second equation is
\begin{equation}
\label{acce1}
a=F/m.
\end{equation}
My first equation is
\begin{equation}
\label{acce2}
F = ma
\end{equation}

In the Sec.~\ref{equations}, I will reference to the equation (\ref{acce1}) above and then reference to the equation (\ref{acce2}).
