Lecture 5 Notes

## bibliography

```LaTeX
\begin{thebibliography}{99}
```
The ``99`` here is the maximum citation you want to enter into the your article.\
Telling LaTex about the maximum citation you want to enter, LaTex will automatically leave spaces. For example, if your maximum citation is 99:
```LaTeX
Reference:
 [1] aaaaaaa %you will get spaces before the one digit number
[99] bbbbbbb
```
